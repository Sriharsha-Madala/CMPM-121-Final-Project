Group 32: Sriharsha Madala, Justin Santario, Kaeden Young, Anna Perlow

We chose the NPC Chase Scene. Our NPC is a monster that is the amalgamation of several everyday objects like chairs, lamps, etc. Our two interactions with this monster are first when you pick up the star with the E button. This sets the monster off to start chasing you. The next interaction is when it catches up with you, at which point you fall over and die. There are obsticles in the player's path which include a chairs, lamps, paintings, ect. For the 5 unique and meaningful objects, there are 2 disntinct paintings, a lamp, a chair, a bookshelf, and a star (that sets off the mosnter). A particle system was added to the door at the end of the hallway to tell the player where the exit is (or is it?). The main character is controllable and has a first person camera that follows them. There are paintings, and other ordaniary objects that add to the spooky ambiance. The regular objects contrast the spooky atmosphere and thus make it spookier. There are spotlights throughout the hall as well that illuminate your path to the door at the end of the hallway.
